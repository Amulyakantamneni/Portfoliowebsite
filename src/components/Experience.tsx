EXPERIENCE

PayPal | AI / Machine Learning Engineer
2024 – Present | San Jose, CA
• Designed and deployed full-stack LLM pipelines for enterprise financial document understanding, including data preprocessing, embedding generation, vector indexing, and multi-step reasoning workflows.
• Developed optimized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using OpenAI, LangChain, FAISS, and Pinecone, improving retrieval relevance by 50% and reducing hallucinations through hybrid semantic + rule-based rankers.
• Built a multi-agent knowledge assistant for internal engineering teams with autonomous task planning, context linking, and tool-use capabilities—reducing manual documentation lookup time by 70%.
• Engineered latency-optimized inference services using FastAPI, async workers, a batching engine, and response streaming; achieved 3× throughput under peak load while cutting P95 latency by 40%.
• Productionized NLP classification and summarization models using Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, and fully managed CI/CD through GitHub Actions and ArgoCD.
• Implemented evaluation pipelines for prompt quality, retrieval accuracy, toxicity safety checks, and regression detection using Weights & Biases and custom dashboards.
• Built internal tools for prompt versioning, data labeling, and dataset quality checks, enabling 4+ teams to rapidly iterate on LLM features.
• Designed monitoring for model drift, embedding integrity, vector DB health and created automated fallback strategies to maintain reliability in distributed environments.

Accenture | AI Engineer (NLP & GenAI)
2022 – 2023 | Hyderabad, India
• Led development of Generative AI automation suites for banking, insurance, and retail domains, including summarization engines, classification models, query routing, and knowledge retrieval systems.
• Built RAG prototypes integrating LangChain, HuggingFace embeddings, and vector databases (FAISS, Qdrant) that reduced client search time by 60–80%.
• Designed domain-adapted LLM pipelines with custom prompt frameworks, system instructions, and fine-tuned adapters for high-accuracy field extraction.
• Built secure API-driven AI microservices using FastAPI, JWT auth, rate limiting, and observability tooling for deployment in multi-tenant enterprise environments.
• Integrated AI systems into client cloud stacks using AWS Lambda, ECS Fargate, CloudWatch, DynamoDB, and S3, ensuring fault-tolerant delivery.
• Collaborated directly with client engineering teams to transform business workflows into AI-ready pipelines, automating repetitive processes and saving thousands of human-hours.
• Implemented evaluation harnesses using Bleu/ROUGE metrics, embedding similarity scoring, and human feedback tools for iterative LLM improvement.
